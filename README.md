# Depression-Detection
📌 Project Overview

Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders worldwide. Early detection can significantly help in timely intervention and support.
This project focuses on automatically detecting depression-related patterns from textual data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

The system analyzes text data (such as social media posts or user-generated content) and classifies it as depressed or non-depressed based on learned linguistic and semantic features.

🎯 Objectives
    To analyze textual data for signs of depression
    To build reliable ML/DL models for depression detection
    To compare traditional machine learning approaches with deep learning models
    To improve detection accuracy using advanced NLP techniques
